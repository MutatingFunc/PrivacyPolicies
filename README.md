# PrivacyPolicies

# Keybuild Privacy Policy

## What is Keybuild?

* Keybuild is an iOS app and companion app extension which allows the creation and modification of software keyboards, for use on-device.
What does Keybuild store?

* Keybuild stores the user's keyboard locally, in a store visible only to the app and its extension.
* Information may also be stored where required for app functionality, keyboard functionality, and state restoration.

## What isn't stored?

* Usage statistics.
* Device information.
* What you type is not stored or collected. ‘What you type’ is defined as text entered by the user through use of ‘Text Stack’ layouts or ‘Type’ actions, via the keyboard extension. The app may be updated to store data relating to other key presses (‘Modifiers’), using the methods described above, where required to enable new app functionality, but never for logging or tracking purposes.

## What is collected?

* The available methods of storage may be extended to include Apple data synchronisation services such as iCloud, in which case Apple may have visibility of the data.
* Excluding the above case, information remains on-device and is not transmitted to any party.

## Responsibility

* The privacy and security of any user-provided data stored by Keybuild is the responsibility of the user, for the following reasons:
  * Keybuild does not encrypt data, or attempt to limit access.
  * Keybuild allows export of unencrypted data to other apps and devices.
  * Keybuild is not intended to store confidential or personally identifying information.
  * The privacy and security of what the user types using the keyboard extension into apps made by other parties, is not my responsibility.
